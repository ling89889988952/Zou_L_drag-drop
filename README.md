# This is a Drag and Drop game.

Written Plan / Path

Problem:

1.	In the origin project , lacking the function to get the related child element to obtain  the images.
2.	Lacking the function to clean the drop area.

Solution:

1.	Add the if syntax to judge the browsers’ behavior.
When browsers pick the piece picture from “puzzle-pieces” area,  and running the function to pick the child element to replace the current image.
2.	Adding the star function, clear the current zone when browser click the bottom image to restart the game.


Detail:

This project star to pick the variable in the origin HTML file, and set those variable
to the defined value. And running the function.

Created the related function, and get the related elements and images by selecting the related Child-element to run and replace. 


Rule:

1. When browsers star the drag & drop game, browsers pick the picture to the 
	Zone Area, if the browser pick the picture in the wrong area, they can
	pick the right picture into the related area directly and the wrong picture 
	will be returned to the origin "puzzle-pieces" area.



2. The browser can click the images in the bottom to start the related Game. 
   Browsers can pick the pieces in the left area to drop in the right area.
   When Browser clicks the images in the bottom, the game will be restared.
